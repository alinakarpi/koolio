As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left.

That even my mama thinks that my mind is gone.

But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it,
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of.
You better watch how you talkin', and where you walkin',
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk.
